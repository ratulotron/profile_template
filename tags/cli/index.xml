The reason behind this is you have already committed the files that you added to .gitignore and now git is tracking the files. Unless you delete them git will keep an eye on any changes on those files as it would do with any other. To get the new .gitignore rule registered with the repo you will have to manually remove tho file(s) from git&amp;rsquo;s cache.</description></item></channel></rss>
