For example I was using a version manager called &amp;lsquo;n&amp;rsquo; and could not integrate Sass in anyway with my Ember app. It all boiled down to my Ember installation not finding libraries needed to compile Sass. These two modules were the reason of the problem: node-gyp and node-sass.
After fiddling around for a while I found out the proper way to setup Sass with Ember.</description></item><item><title>If Gitignore does not ignore</title><link>/posts/2015-04-15-if-gitignore-does-not-ignore/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Apr 2015 11:03:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/2015-04-15-if-gitignore-does-not-ignore/</guid><description>Sometimes after changing your .gitignore the new (un)ignored files don&amp;rsquo;t get get behind the scenes, as you would have expected. The reason behind this is you have already committed the files that you added to .gitignore and now git is tracking the files. Unless you delete them git will keep an eye on any changes on those files as it would do with any other. To get the new .gitignore rule registered with the repo you will have to manually remove tho file(s) from git&amp;rsquo;s cache.</description></item></channel></rss>
