I am a very impatient person, and my attention span is short. My mom used to 
say that when I was a kid, I couldn't keep playing with one toy for more than 
five minutes. If any skill a programmer needs more than anything else, that is 
patience. Luckily I was patient enough to sit tight and think about my skills 
as a programmer. I did a small SWOT(Strength, Weakness, Opportunities and 
Threat) analysis. These are what I found:

| Strengths     | Weaknesses    | Opportunities | Threats       |
| Open minded   | Impatience    | Python        | Inconsistency |
